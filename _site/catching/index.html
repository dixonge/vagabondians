<p>One thing that I really like about other travel blogs that I read is when they write about where they are right now, not about some place they visited years ago.  We've been trying to do that, but the tricky part is that we have been seeing so many places and taking so many pictures that it is difficult to keep up!  As a matter of fact, I (Glenn) am flat out behind.  But I'm about to catch up!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for many, many posts about what we have been doing, the details.  And pictures too!  Coming really soon!</p>
