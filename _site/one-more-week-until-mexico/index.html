<p>What would you do if you had only one week left in the country you were born and raised in?</p>
<p>I know what we're going to do -- work! Looks like we'll be able to fit our stuff into our Rick Steves carry-on bags, but there are a lot of little leftover pieces and parts. So today is eBay day!  We plan on heading to Denton on Friday. Glenn will be seeing some old co-workers for the first time in a long time, and we are trying to work in a few other people as well.</p>
<p>We ended up renting a car which we'll drop off at the airport when we are ready to depart next week. Our homeowner sent us a few car parts to take with us, so we'll have one bag to check, which gives us a bit of extra room for miscellaneous items if we can't fit them in the overhead bags. Speaking of bags...</p>
<p>The picture you see attached to this article is from 2008. We packed for our trip to Mexico using two bags each. One overhead, one under the seat. All carry-on, no checked bags. This time we're doing the same thing (not counting the checked bag of car parts) but there is one major difference between now and 2008 — this time we're not going for ten days, we're going for several months! Basically, this is everything we own.</p>
<p>OK, enough chit-chat -- time to get busy!</p>
