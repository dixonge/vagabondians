There’s a new photo contest going on and I was 'tagged' by my friend Wes (aka <a href="https://johnnyvagabond.com">Johnny Vagabond</a>). Sponsored by <a href="https://www.travelsupermarket.com/">TravelSupermarket.com</a>, there are some great prizes (iPads!) and the contest is being judged by some amazing photographers/bloggers.

The rules are pretty simple: post photos on your blog that fit the following themes: Red, Blue, White, Green and Yellow. Share your post via social media (see the rules below for details) and nominate five other bloggers to join in the fun. If you don’t have all five, post what you have. Easy!

[Ken Kaminesky][1] is judging the **Blue** category. Daniel of [Canvas of Light][2] is in charge of **Red**, while Abi of [Inside the Travel Lab][3] will be looking over the **Green** entries. Dave and Deb of [The Planet D][4] are in charge of **Yellow** and Christine over at [Almost Fearless][5] will judge **White**.

The contest ends August 27th, and the winner of each color category will receive a new iPad. The overall winner will net a £2,000 travel budget from [TravelSupermarket.com][6]. You don’t have to be nominated to participate, so dig through those photos and get to blogging!

Here are my entries...

This is from Humboldt Redwoods State Park in northern California. In the background you can see the roots of one of many fallen Coastal Redwoods. It was never a record-holder, but it probably lived several hundred years before it fell. Most people probably don't take this shot, but something about the surrounding greenery and lighting caught my attention.

After a long day on the south side of Yellowstone National Park taking photos of geysers Bryn shot this wonderfully diffuse sunset through the windshield. It came out much better than I ever would have thought possible.
