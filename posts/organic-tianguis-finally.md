What the heck is a "tianguis"? you might ask.  Well, I believe it's loosely translated as a flea market. Back in Chapala, Jalisco, MX, they had the weekly tianguis, and you could buy almost anything there. Blocks of temporary stalls lining both sides of the street, everything from shoes to clothing to jewelry to toys; live farm animals and all kinds of fresh produce; stalls where savory food was prepared before your eyes.

Here in San Cristobal, Chiapas, MX, they have a huge market selling all kinds of things daily. The stalls are set up each morning early with a dazzling array of items. It covers several blocks, including permanent buildings.

But today we finally made it to the organic tianguis housed twice weekly in a building near one of the walking streets. It's small, but the local farmers and sellers grow and use all organic methods. No chemical pesticides, hormones, antibiotics in their wares. The veggies and greens are just beautiful and full, not the wilty, buggy stuff you often find at the big market or the dried-out, old produce you often find at the big grocery stores. Don't get me wrong, there are some beautiful offerings at the big market too, just not all are created equal.

At this little market, people make fresh breads, salsas, sauces, pizzas, cheeses, desserts, local honey and other offerings. Beautiful fruits and vegetables.

Here is a table with freshly butchered rabbit and chicken, homemade sausages and other meats.

Today we were after k<span style="color: #222222;">ombucha, which is a lightly effervescent fermented drink (not alcoholic) that is loaded with probiotics. The lady had jamaica (hibiscus) and lemon-hierbabuena (lemon-mint) flavors. Mmmm, so nice and healthful! We also bought a nice loaf of homemade bread from her, and a hunk of soft, flavored homemade cheese from another lady that hails from Argentina.</span>

We will definitely be back regularly to purchase produce and chicken and other tasty treats -- and definitely more kombucha!
