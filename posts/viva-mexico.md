It has been a wonderful few months with family and friends, but we are about to move on to Phase 2. That's the part where we leave the United States! It took a lot of research and discussion but we finally got it all set. We are going to start in Mexico!

There are a couple of good reasons for this. For one thing, we're familiar with Mexico, having last traveled there back in 2008. For another, it is where we were able to get our first housesitting assignment!

For those of you who haven't been following along on Facebook, we're flying to Chapala, Mexico to begin housesitting on February 15. We will be taking care of a house, two dogs and two cats for awhile. Our only expense will be groceries and entertainment! We'll be free to do some daytrips and see some local sights. Free WiFi, a car available for short trips to the grocery store or bus stop.

We already have a friend of a friend who lives down there who we can meet, and we are hoping to meet up with <a href="https://RetireEarlyLifestyle.com" target="_blank">Billy and Akaisha Kaderli</a>, if they aren't tromping around Central America by then. We're looking forward to exploring the lake and the small towns around it.

We have sold the tent camper, now we just have to sell the Montero and then figure out how to cram all our stuff into our backpacks. That can't be too hard, right?
