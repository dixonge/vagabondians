I know, tiki is so South Pacific and we’re in Mexico -- but it’s also retro American kitsch that evokes silliness and warmth and friends having cocktails at sunset. So grab your tiki mug and just go with me!

So what could be so different about food prep in Mexico? What’s the big deal? Well, for me, it is quite different and a challenge. I can’t really put my finger on one thing or one area and explain it to anyone, so there will be several articles in this series about food purchase, preparation, and cooking -- and some authentic Mexican recipes that I find easy and tasty.

Disclaimer: First off, I’m no cocinera! I can cook basic stuff fairly well at home in the US. But when I came to Mexico, I found so many differences in the food and how it cooks and what’s available, that I had to stop and regroup and ask for help from an expert -- our Mexican housekeeper. (She came with the house-sit job -- score!)

We're going to explore shopping and cooking here in the state of Jalisco, Mexico.  From what I hear, this vast country has many styles, and each state is different. Hang onto your hats -- it's not Tex Mex!
