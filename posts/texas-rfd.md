Sorry, I just really, REALLY love that old Louis Prima song. 

And yes, we're back in Texas! I sometimes forget that not everyone is following along via Facebook and Twitter. But you really should! That is where you get the latest updates, the minutiae.

Obviously I have not been very good at keeping up with the photos and travel tales. So many to do! But I have some ideas rattling around in my head about how to catch up and keep up, and we're gonna need it! Oh my, the plans we have....

So, as I think you probably already know, we are planning on staying here for a couple of months. We will see my parents and brother, and we have lots of friends to reunite with and catch up on. Bryn is already planning a weekend with her bestest friend in the world for her friend's birthday. Big girls' night out with the Jazzercise gang too. We also have friends everywhere from south Arlington to Denton to see again. Wine Squared, I'm thinking of you!

And then there's the work part. We've emptied the pop-up, now we need to clean and sell it. We also have lots of camping crap to sell, and eventually we'll sell the SUV too. And then we hop on a plane with a one-way ticket to.......

Well, that's a good question, isn't it? Frankly it all depends. One part of our overall plan that has changed a little bit is that we are going to further increase our fun factor while reducing our expenses by housesitting! And so our next destination really depends on which housesitting opportunities work out first. Maybe Lake Chapala in central Mexico? And we probably have something lined up for Costa Rica in July or August. We get to use someone's house, and they don't have to worry about the house looking vacant. Pets get fed and walked, lawns get watered. It's a win-win!

So that's all for now, stay tuned for updates!
